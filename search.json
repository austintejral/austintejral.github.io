    "title": "Why Nebraska football’s biggest issue is developing talent.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "No one can argue that the most important part of college football is the players. Good players, good football team, right? Well, for Nebraska fans unfortunately that may not be the case. Recruiting in football is almost as exciting to pay attention to as a game itself, the excitement to see which young prospect your team has secured over its competitors.\nNebraska simply put is not bad at recruiting, which for other schools in the Big Ten is a slight issue. The Huskers are an exciting team on paper each and every year, but once that fall season rolls around its nothing but sad faces in the sea of red.\nEach year 24/7 Sports ranks prospects all around the nation and assigns them a corresponding star grade if they are worthy of it, the most common rankings are 3-5 stars. The more gifted the prospect the higher rating they are assigned.\nThis leads to, in theory, good football times right? Lets take a look at who’s been the most successful at recruiting graded talent over the last 10 years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nstandings &lt;- read_csv(\"standings.csv\")\nrecruits &lt;- read_csv(\"RecruitingData.csv\")\nbigtenrank &lt;- read_csv(\"rankingsbigten.csv\")\ncombined &lt;- read_csv(\"combinedrecstan.csv\")\n\nbigstandings &lt;- standings |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"Big Ten (East)\" |\n         Conf == \"Big Ten (West)\")\nrecruittotals &lt;-recruits |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TFStotalfives = sum(TFSFiveStars),\n    TFStotalfours = sum(TFSFourStars),\n    TFStotalthrees = sum(TFSThreeStars))\ntfstotals &lt;- recruittotals |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"TFS\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"Stars\"\n  )\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=tfstotals, aes(x=reorder(Team, Stars), weight=Stars, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values=c(\"gold\", \"darkblue\", \"darkred\"),\n    labels=c('Five Stars', 'Four Stars', 'Three Stars'))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Teams\",\n    y=\"Total graded recruits\",\n    title=\"Nebraska attracts a shocking amount of recruits\",\n    subtitle=\"Nebraska finishes third within total graded recruits over the past 10 years\n    without a single 5-star recruit\",\n    caption=\"Source: 24/7 Sports | By Austin Tejral\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow seeing teams like Ohio State and Michigan at the top should be no surprise as they have been some of the best teams in the Big Ten, but sneaking in right at the three spot Nebraska makes an appearance. Nebraska managed to pull in 224 graded recruits in the last ten years which is a bit of a surprise. Now recruiting only matters if they make an impact on the field, so let’s see how recruiting ranking matches up with where a team finished in the Big Ten at the end of the season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=bigtenrank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=bigtenrank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = bigtenrank |&gt; filter(Year == min(Year)), aes(x = Year - .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = bigtenrank |&gt; filter(Year == max(Year)), aes(x = Year + .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#13294B\", \"#990000\", \"#FFCD00\", \"#E03A3E\", \"#00274C\", \"#18453B\", \"#7A0019\", \"lightgreen\", \"#4E2A84\", \"#BB0000\", \"#041E42\", \"#CEB888\", \"#CC0033\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Rank\",\n    title=\"Nebraska struggles to do well in the Big Ten\",\n    subtitle=\"They have failed to make a top-8 finish within the Big Ten since 2016\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Austin Tejral\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  ) +\n  scale_y_reverse()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a lot of Husker fans that light green line should tell you nothing you haven’t suffered through already, Nebraska has stunk. Now you might be thinking if Nebraska has been this bad for this long then those recruiting numbers are probably skewed due to recruits coming during Nebraska’s top-6 finishes.\nOh how we all wish that was the case, lets take a look at 24/7 Sports’ recruiting rank over the last ten years.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=recruits, aes(x=Year, y=TFSRank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=recruits, aes(x=Year, y=TFSRank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = recruits |&gt; filter(Year == min(Year)), aes(x = Year - .2, y=TFSRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = recruits |&gt; filter(Year == max(Year)), aes(x = Year + .2, y=TFSRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#13294B\", \"#990000\", \"#FFCD00\", \"#E03A3E\", \"#00274C\", \"#18453B\", \"#7A0019\", \"lightgreen\", \"#4E2A84\", \"#BB0000\", \"#041E42\", \"#CEB888\", \"#CC0033\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Rank\",\n    title=\"The Huskers still manage to be a Top-5 recruiting school\",\n    subtitle=\"Shockingly even without any success in the Big Ten recently Nebraska managed to have a \n    Top-5 recruiting class 8 out of the last 10 years\",\n    caption=\"Source: 24/7 Sports | By Austin Tejral\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_x_continuous()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShockingly Nebraska has managed to consistently pull in recruiting classes without ever showing results. This then brings to question do wins even lead to recruits, or do recruits even positively equate to wins.\nOne way to test this is to add up all of the star values over the last 10 years for each Big Ten School and plot them against total wins. Let’s take a look.\n\n\nCode\nnebcombined &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=TotalWins, y=TFSTotalStar)) +\n  geom_point(data=nebcombined, aes(x=TotalWins, y=TFSTotalStar, colour=\"darkred\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=50, y=800, label=\"Lots of recruits, Low wins\", colour=\"blue\")) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=90, y=580, label=\"Low recruits, High wins\", colour=\"blue\")) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 69.5) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 680) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=combined,\n    aes(x=TotalWins, y=TFSTotalStar, label=Team) \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Wins\",\n    y=\"Total Stars Value\",\n    title=\"The Huskers can't seem to either keep or develop their talent\",\n    subtitle=\"Nebraska stands alone as they finished high on overall star count, but below-average Sssin wins\",\n    caption=\"Source: 24/7 Sports and Sports Reference | By Austin Tejral\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heartbreaking truth is brought to light, Nebraska unfortunately stands all by itself in a terrible corner. Nebraska managed the fourth highest overall star count, but fails to translate these players into wins. Which the best recruiters in the Big Ten have done and done well.\nThis brings us to an unsettling reality, can the Huskers develop their talent in order to top the Big Ten, the data points to no. This however will not kill many Husker fans’ spirit as I, much like many others, will continue to drink the Kool-Aid and watch 2024’s 6th ranked draft class turn the Huskers into national champions once again."
