    "section": "",
    "text": "Most football fans at some point in time have probably played the football game made by EA sports that they put out each and every year, Madden. Madden has been a fan favorite for a while but this comes with some speculation, early in the games history seemingly every player featured on the cover either was injured or regressed statistically. Such as Michael Vick who was named cover of Madden ’05 and was forced to sit out most of the season. Is this still something that happens with modern game releases or has the curse run its course? One way you could look at this is by looking at the stats of the players before and after the game release. Lets take a look.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nqbs &lt;- read_csv(\"MaddenQBSportsData.csv\")\nrbs &lt;- read_csv(\"MaddenRBSportsData.csv\")\nrec &lt;- read_csv(\"MaddenWRTESportsData.csv\")\ndef &lt;- read_csv(\"MaddenDBSportsData.csv\")\ncas &lt;- read_csv(\"CoverAthleteStats.csv\")\ncastable &lt;- cas |&gt;\n  select(Name, Pos, YdsBC, YdsAC, YPGBC, YPGAC)\ncastable |&gt; gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Pos = \"Position\",\n    YdsBC = \"Season Yards Before Becoming Cover Athlete\",\n    YdsAC = \"Season Yards After Becoming Cover Athlete\",\n    YPGBC = \"Yards Per Game Before Cover Athlete\",\n    YPGAC = \"Yards Per Game After Cover Athlete\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Brady improves following his cover announcements\",\n    subtitle = \"Tom saw production increases both times he was the face of madden, even leading the league in passing yards in 2021.\"\n  )  |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\", size=22),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\", size=16),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n   source_note = md(\"**By:** Austin Tejral   |   **Source:** Pro Football Reference\") \n    ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(2)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#002145\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#C8032B\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = YdsBC == \"3554\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#D50A0A\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#B1BABF\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = YdsBC == \"4633\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrady improves following his cover announcements\n\n\nTom saw production increases both times he was the face of madden, even leading the league in passing yards in 2021.\n\n\nName\nPosition\nSeason Yards Before Becoming Cover Athlete\nSeason Yards After Becoming Cover Athlete\nYards Per Game Before Cover Athlete\nYards Per Game After Cover Athlete\n\n\n\n\nDrew Brees\nQB\n4388\n4620\n292.5\n288.8\n\n\nPeyton Hillis\nRB\n1177\n587\n73.6\n58.7\n\n\nCalvin Johnson\nWR\n1681\n1964\n105.1\n122.8\n\n\nAdrian Peterson\nRB\n2037\n1266\n131.1\n90.4\n\n\nRichard Sherman\nDB\n48\n57\n8.0\n4.0\n\n\nOdell Beckham Jr.\nWR\n1305\n1450\n108.8\n96.7\n\n\nRob Gronkowski\nTE\n1176\n540\n78.4\n67.5\n\n\nTom Brady\nQB\n3554\n4577\n296.2\n286.1\n\n\nAntonio Brown\nWR\n1533\n1297\n109.5\n86.5\n\n\nPatrick Mahomes\nQB\n5097\n4031\n318.6\n287.9\n\n\nLamar Jackson\nQB\n3127\n2757\n208.5\n183.8\n\n\nPatrick Mahomes\nQB\n4740\n4839\n316.0\n284.6\n\n\nTom Brady\nQB\n4633\n5316\n289.6\n312.7\n\n\nJosh Allen\nQB\n4283\n4306\n267.7\n253.3\n\n\n\nBy: Austin Tejral | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table we can see that largely from a statistical standpoint there really isn’t much of a change except for a couple of players. Most notably a large regressions from Peyton Hillis, and Rob Gronkowski. Interestingly enough Tom Brady actually improves from one season to the next. This doesn’t tell the whole story though what if it was just a down year for that position could be plausiable.

Most of the players who grace the cover stay in the upper echelon of players in the NFL period, 0-2 that the curse exists, but maybe it just effects the overall team so let’s take a look at the wins.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=cas,\n    aes(y=reorder(Name, YearOneWins), x=YearOneWins, xend=YearTwoWins),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Wins\",\n    y= \"Name\",\n    title = \"Gronkowski, along with Brady the only ones not effected by the curse in wins\",\n    subtitle = \"Rob and Tom continue to get more wins in the season following the cover, than wins the season before they were the cover.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Austin Tejral\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 6), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell there it is, each cover athlete, with the exception of Brady and Gronk, lost more the following season after they were on the cover. It isn’t even a wash of games either with each player it usually sits around 2 games which in tight playoff races makes a difference. So for the question of whether or not the curse still exists it remains plausible, but largely it seems to have taken a break from the NFL. It has failed to adapt to the 2010s decade and players can for the most part rest easy knowing the curse doesn’t have them in their sights anymore, now the team as a whole maybe watch your back."

    "section": "",
    "text": "No one can argue that the most important part of college football is the players. Good players, good football team, right? Well, for Nebraska fans unfortunately that may not be the case. Recruiting in football is almost as exciting to pay attention to as a game itself, the excitement to see which young prospect your team has secured over its competitors.\nNebraska simply put is not bad at recruiting, which for other schools in the Big Ten is a slight issue. The Huskers are an exciting team on paper each and every year, but once that fall season rolls around its nothing but sad faces in the sea of red.\nEach year 24/7 Sports ranks prospects all around the nation and assigns them a corresponding star grade if they are worthy of it, the most common rankings are 3-5 stars. The more gifted the prospect, the higher rating they are assigned.\nThis leads to, in theory, good football teams right? Lets take a look at who’s been the most successful at recruiting graded talent over the last 10 years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nstandings &lt;- read_csv(\"standings.csv\")\nrecruits &lt;- read_csv(\"RecruitingData.csv\")\nbigtenrank &lt;- read_csv(\"rankingsbigten.csv\")\ncombined &lt;- read_csv(\"combinedrecstan.csv\")\n\nbigstandings &lt;- standings |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"Big Ten (East)\" |\n         Conf == \"Big Ten (West)\")\nrecruittotals &lt;-recruits |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TFStotalfives = sum(TFSFiveStars),\n    TFStotalfours = sum(TFSFourStars),\n    TFStotalthrees = sum(TFSThreeStars))\ntfstotals &lt;- recruittotals |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"TFS\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"Stars\"\n  )\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=tfstotals, aes(x=reorder(Team, Stars), weight=Stars, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values=c(\"gold\", \"darkblue\", \"darkred\"),\n    labels=c('Five Stars', 'Four Stars', 'Three Stars'))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Teams\",\n    y=\"Total graded recruits\",\n    title=\"Nebraska attracts a shocking amount of recruits\",\n    subtitle=\"Nebraska finishes third within total graded recruits over the past 10 years\n    without a single 5-star recruit\",\n    caption=\"Source: 24/7 Sports | By Austin Tejral\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow seeing teams like Ohio State and Michigan at the top should be no surprise as they have been some of the best teams in the Big Ten, but sneaking in right at the three spot Nebraska makes an appearance. Nebraska managed to pull in 224 graded recruits in the last ten years which is a bit of a surprise. Now recruiting only matters if they make an impact on the field, so let’s see how recruiting ranking matches up with where a team finished in the Big Ten at the end of the season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=bigtenrank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=bigtenrank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = bigtenrank |&gt; filter(Year == min(Year)), aes(x = Year - .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = bigtenrank |&gt; filter(Year == max(Year)), aes(x = Year + .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#13294B\", \"#990000\", \"#FFCD00\", \"#E03A3E\", \"#00274C\", \"#18453B\", \"#7A0019\", \"lightgreen\", \"#4E2A84\", \"#BB0000\", \"#041E42\", \"#CEB888\", \"#CC0033\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Rank\",\n    title=\"Nebraska struggles to do well in the Big Ten\",\n    subtitle=\"They have failed to make a top-8 finish within the Big Ten since 2016\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Austin Tejral\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023))+\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a lot of Husker fans that light green line should tell them nothing they haven’t suffered through already, Nebraska has stunk. Now you might be thinking if Nebraska has been this bad for this long then those recruiting numbers are probably skewed due to recruits coming during Nebraska’s top-6 finishes.\nOh how we all wish that was the case, lets take a look at 24/7 Sports’ recruiting rank over the last ten years.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=recruits, aes(x=Year, y=TFSRank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=recruits, aes(x=Year, y=TFSRank, colour=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = recruits |&gt; filter(Year == min(Year)), aes(x = Year - .2, y=TFSRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = recruits |&gt; filter(Year == max(Year)), aes(x = Year + .2, y=TFSRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#13294B\", \"#990000\", \"#FFCD00\", \"#E03A3E\", \"#00274C\", \"#18453B\", \"#7A0019\", \"lightgreen\", \"#4E2A84\", \"#BB0000\", \"#041E42\", \"#CEB888\", \"#CC0033\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Rank\",\n    title=\"The Huskers still manage to be a Top-5 recruiting school\",\n    subtitle=\"Shockingly even without any success in the Big Ten recently Nebraska managed to have a \n    Top-5 recruiting class 8 out of the last 10 years\",\n    caption=\"Source: 24/7 Sports | By Austin Tejral\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022))+\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShockingly Nebraska has managed to consistently pull in recruiting classes without ever showing results. This then brings to question do wins even lead to recruits, or do recruits even positively equate to wins.\nOne way to test this is to add up all of the star values over the last 10 years for each Big Ten School and plot them against total wins. Let’s take a look.\n\n\nCode\nnebcombined &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=TotalWins, y=TFSTotalStar)) +\n  geom_point(data=nebcombined, aes(x=TotalWins, y=TFSTotalStar, colour=\"darkred\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=50, y=800, label=\"Lots of recruits, Low wins\", colour=\"blue\")) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=90, y=580, label=\"Low recruits, High wins\", colour=\"blue\")) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 69.5) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 680) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=combined,\n    aes(x=TotalWins, y=TFSTotalStar, label=Team) \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Wins\",\n    y=\"Total Stars Value\",\n    title=\"The Huskers can't seem to either keep or develop their talent\",\n    subtitle=\"Nebraska stands alone as they finished high on overall star count, but below-average Sssin wins\",\n    caption=\"Source: 24/7 Sports and Sports Reference | By Austin Tejral\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heartbreaking truth is brought to light, Nebraska unfortunately stands all by itself in a terrible corner. Nebraska managed the fourth highest overall star count, but fails to translate these players into wins. Which the best recruiters in the Big Ten have done and done well.\nThis brings us to an unsettling reality, can the Huskers develop their talent in order to top the Big Ten, the data points to no. This however will not kill many Husker fans’ spirits as I, much like many others, will continue to drink the Kool-Aid and watch 2024’s 6th ranked draft class turn the Huskers into national champions once again."
